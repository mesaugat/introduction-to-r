# Introduction to R

[Future Learn](https://futurelearn.com) - [Introduction to R for Data Science](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/data-science)

A 4-week course to learn the fundamentals of the R platform. Anyone with basic programming knowledge can finish this course within a week.

I created these slides while going through the course myself. It is recommended to watch the course videos if you are a complete beginner. You can also find my practice files for every week in each folder.
